            <p>Seena Jon is a comedian, producer, actor, and lawyer.  He is a center-left tech-forward progressive who lives by the simple phrase “funny comes first.”</p>
            <p>A ten-year veteran of the New York comedy scene, Seena got his start in stand-up as a college student. After interning at the US Senate as a freshman, he decided to pursue the true performing arts as a comedian in Los Angeles. Since then, he has performed all over the country and at numerous places in New York, including the Comedy Cellar, Caroline’s, Gotham, the Broadway comedy Club, and the People’s Improv Theater. He also hosts and produces a stand-up show that has starred comedians like Michael Che, Jeff Ross, and Mark Normand.</p>
            <p>Seena has had a variety of onscreen roles in both television and film. In 2006, he played an accused assassin of George W. Bush in the film Death of A President, which won the International Critic’s Prize at the Toronto Film Festival in 2006. In 2014, he was a guest host for nearly a dozen episodes of Take Part Live, a daily news show on Pivot TV that has a cable subscriber base of 40 million people. On the show, which he co-hosted with Meghan McCain, Baratunde Thurston, and Jacob Soboroff, Seena interviewed notables like Kermit the Frog, Reza Aslan, and Jay Rogers, the creator of the first 3D printed car. Seena also produces and stars in a dance show which he learns the world’s dance forms by immersing himself in different cultures and trying to win the approval of their respective dance experts.</p>
            <p>In a misguided attempt to bolster his street cred, Seena went to law school at night while working as a producing during the day. during that time he interned for the White House under the Obama administration, and later became a member of NORML’s legal committee. After law school, Seena wanted to merge his producing and policy skills. In 2013, Seena worked as a producer at NYU’s Governance Lab, an organization funded the by the MacArthur Foundation and the Knight Foundation  that aims to improve governance and our public systems though science and technology. Seena continues to produce freelance work, including commercials, art shows, corporate branded content, and educational content.</p>
            <p>Seena’s productions invite audiences to immerse themselves in wry narratives steeped in social commentary and current events. He was the Executive Producer of Bear Sterns Bravo, an interactive art project that allowed audiences to experience a cyber-punk farce that parodied the financial collapse. Which along with its related projects horse_ebooks and Pronunciation Book, was written up in numerous national publications including the New Yorker. He also produced This is My Milwaukee, which was later optioned to Sony Pictures Digital.</p>
            <p>Seena’s weekly podcast, The Brighter Side, is hardcore self-help that attempts to put a positive spin on subjects like depression, rage and jealousy. Guests have included Saman Arbabi, P Funk keyboardist Danny Bedrosian, Michael Che, and Henry Zebrowski.  It is available on iTunes, where it is frequently in the top 200.</p>
